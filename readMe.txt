Protect yourself and those around you:

Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.
Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.
Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.
Clean your hands frequently with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of used tissues immediately and clean hands regularly. 
If you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19, self-isolate until you recover.

Wear a mask properly
To properly wear your mask:

Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.
Clean your hands before you put your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask or dispose of it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask.
Don’t use masks with valves.
